# Car-Insights
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze car sales data across different manufacturers, models, and years. The dataset includes details such as engine size, fuel type, year of manufacture, mileage, units sold, price, and total sales. The dashboard provides visual insights into sales performance,.

# Car Sales Dashboard

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Organize and clean a car sales dataset for analysis.
- Create pivot tables and charts to summarize key metrics.
- Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore sales data by manufacturer, fuel type, and year.
- Enable easy visualization and interpretation of large datasets for better decision-making.

## Process
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   - Compiled data for multiple car manufacturers and models.  
   - Standardized columns, ensured proper formats for numbers, dates, and currency.  
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent entries.

2. **Pivot Table Creation:**  
   - Created three pivot tables to summarize key metrics:
     - Total sales by manufacturer.
     - Units sold by fuel type.
     - Manufacturer sales by year.

3. **Chart Visualization:**  
   - Developed pivot charts based on the pivot tables:
     - Total sales of all manufacturers.
     - Units sold by fuel type.
     - Manufacturer-wise sales across years.
   - Added slicers for interactive filtering by year, fuel type, and manufacturer.

4. **Dashboard Development:**  
   - Combined pivot tables and charts into a clean dashboard layout.  
   - Ensured readability and interactive features for easier data exploration.  

5. **Review and Testing:**  
   - Verified accuracy of totals, sales calculations, and slicer functionality.  
   - Ensured the dashboard provides meaningful insights at a glance.
